Function Code:


    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
    require(_to != address(0), "ERC20: transfer to the zero address");
    require(_value <= balanceOf(msg.sender), "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance");
    
    _balances[msg.sender] = _balances[msg.sender].sub(_value);
    _balances[_to] = _balances[_to].add(_value);
    emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
    return true;
    }
    
Encoding/Decoding or Call Method used: call

Explanation:  

Purpose:

The transfer function in the GNY Token contract is designed to facilitate the transfer of tokens from one address to another. It ensures that the sender has enough balance to make the transfer and that the recipient address is valid.

Detailed Usage:

Transfer Execution: The function checks that the recipient address _to is not a zero address and that the sender has enough balance to cover the _value being transferred.
Balance Update: The sender's balance is decreased by _value and the recipient's balance is increased by the same amount.
Logging: The Transfer event is emitted to log the details of the transfer, ensuring transparency and traceability.
Return Value: The function returns true to indicate a successful transfer.

Impact:

The use of the call method within the transfer function enables the GNY Token contract to handle token transfers securely and efficiently. By ensuring that all necessary checks are performed before updating balances, the function helps maintain the integrity of the token's accounting system. Additionally, the Transfer event provides a clear log of all token movements, which is crucial for auditing and verifying transactions on the blockchain.
